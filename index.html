                        <p>While universities promote academic excellence and personal growth, they often overlook the unintended consequences of relentless pressure and cultural displacement on student mental health. Despite the availability of counseling services at most institutions, these reactive approaches fail to address the deeper, systemic issues that contribute to anxiety, burnout, and self-doubt.</p>
                        <p>As a computer science major with an international background, I've witnessed firsthand how intense academic demands, cultural transitions, and isolation affect students across diverse populations and disciplines.</p>

                        <h3>Beyond Traditional Counseling</h3>
                        <p>"Counseling centers have seen extraordinary increases in demand over the past decade," notes Michael Gerard Mason, PhD, associate dean of African American Affairs at the University of Virginia (UVA). "Even if we continue hiring, I don't think we could ever staff our way out of this challenge."</p>
                        <p>Schools across the country are embracing more innovative approaches to support student mental health, recognizing that many students benefit from peer connections and mentorship rather than traditional one-on-one therapy alone.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "This increase in demand has challenged institutions to think holistically and take a multifaceted approach to supporting students. It really has to be everyone's responsibility at the university to create a culture of well-being."
