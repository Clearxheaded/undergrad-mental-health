# Undergraduate Mental Health Project

## Project Overview

This website is a multimodal adaptation of academic research conducted for WRS106 (Writing Studies) during the Spring Semester. The research focuses on the mental health challenges faced by undergraduate students, exploring the prevalence, causes, impacts, and potential solutions to this growing concern.

## Research Background

The original research was conducted as part of my WRS106 writing class, where I explored the rising mental health issues among undergraduate students. The research investigated:

- The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among college students
- Major contributing factors to declining mental health
- The impact of mental health issues on academic performance
- Institutional support systems and their effectiveness
- Strategies and interventions that can improve student wellbeing

## Website Purpose

This website transforms the academic research into an accessible, interactive, and visually engaging format. The multimodal adaptation aims to:

1. Make research findings accessible to a broader audience
2. Visualize data and statistics related to student mental health
3. Provide interactive tools for self-assessment and resource discovery
4. Create awareness about mental health challenges facing undergraduates
5. Connect students with appropriate mental health resources

## Technical Implementation

The website is built using:

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- Mobile-first approach to design
- Accessibility considerations for all users

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

- Add more interactive data visualizations
- Expand the resource directory with location-specific options
- Implement user accounts for personalized recommendations
- Create a community forum for peer support
- Develop institution-specific versions with tailored resources

## Academic Context

This project represents an exploration of multimodal composition, transforming traditional academic research into a digital, interactive format. It demonstrates how scholarly work can be adapted for broader accessibility and engagement while maintaining academic integrity.
